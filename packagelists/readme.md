# Package Lists

- `testpackagelist`: As the name suggests, the list for testing the bootstrap script, `strap.sh`.
- `esspackagelist`: Essential packages that must be installed for a basic configuration of my system. Includes all (actively used) programs, plus a few others. (_NOTE:_ Do not use as of now, it is very outdated.)
- `fullpackagelist`: The entire list of all packages currently installed on my system. It's basically the output of `pacman -Qqet`.
